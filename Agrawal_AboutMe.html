          <p class="container col-8">After learning about the world of robotics, I constantly wanted something to do with my hands, to be able to make
            something that solved a problem.  For this reason, I want to work as something in the engineering field, though I'm not exactly sure whether to
            go with the hardware or software side of the field.  To find out exactly what I want to do, I'm taking two hardware classes and two software
            classes in high school; Computer Science Principles, Principles of Enigineering, AP Computer Science Applications, and Digital Electronics.
            <br></br>
            I am currently a freshman at Dublin High School.  My name is Vedant Agrawal, and I recently turned 14 years old.  I was selected as an intern for
            a VEX Robotics Competition team, 5327C, at the end of 8th grade.  Throughout the summer, I went to their meets and contributed to the team, and
            when the school year started, I was accepted as an official part of their team.  In addition to that, I am currently taking Comuter Science
            Principles as my elective.
            <br></br>
            These experiences have taught me that if I put in effort and dedicate my time then I can acheive many things that seem impossible at first.
            Another thing that I have learned through them is that I will have to prioritize my time(in this case between school, robotics, and tennis).
            You can read more about my exeriences through my resume and the projects tab at the top of the page.  Thank you for your time.
