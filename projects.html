              The objective of this project was to recreate a project on the App Inventor website, and put my own spin on it. Me and my partner decided
              to use OhMySpikes.  OhMySpikes is a game very much like Flappy Bird, but the screen doesn't "move".  The bird hits the wall and switches
              direction instead.  This game had no sense of gravity, and had a very bland color scheme.  Another problem was that this game was made for a
              tablet of smaller size than the ones we were working with.  We saw this problem and decided to tackle it first.  We wanted to make the game
              be able to work on any tablet size, so we decided to change the pizel values to percents.  We also added more values so that the spikes
              wouldn't be as predictable.  The next thing we did was to make the bird follow the laws of physics and added gravity to the game, turning the
              monotonous up and down of the bird into an arc.  We did this by realizing that the prefered arc looked a lot like a parabola, and in turn
              using the equation for one to define the arc of the bird.  After doing this, we didn't have the time to add our next wanted feature(moving
              spikes after a certain score) before the first gallery walk.  We tested the game for gliches, and found that the grayscale color scheme
              wasn't very pleasant to look at for long periods of time.  We changed the backgroud color to sky blue to help break up the screen layout.  We
              got a lot of feedback from the gallery walk that said to make the game harder.  We decided to carry out our plan to start moving one spike
              after level 10, and two spikes after level 15.  This was the hardest part of the project, since the spikes would keep facing the wrong
              direction while moving.  In the end, I went and changed the image file for the spikes so the spikes would always face in all directions.
              This project taught me that there are multiple ways of coding things, though some work better than others.  It also showed me that it can be
              hard to find certain bits of code if everything is unorganised.
