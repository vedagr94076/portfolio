              The objective of this project was to recreate a project on the App Inventor website, and put my own spin on it. Me and my partner decided
              to use OhMySpikes.  OhMySpikes is a game very much like Flappy Bird, but the screen doesn't "move".  The bird hits the wall and switches
              direction instead.  This game had no sense of gravity, and had a very bland color scheme.  Another problem was that this game was made for a
              tablet of smaller size than the ones we were working with.  We saw this problem and decided to tackle it first.  We wanted to make the game
              be able to work on any tablet size, so we decided to change the pixel values to percents.  We also added more values so that the spikes
              wouldn't be as predictable.  The next thing we did was to make the bird follow the laws of physics and added gravity to the game, turning the
              monotonous up and down of the bird into an arc.  We did this by realizing that the prefered arc looked a lot like a parabola, and in turn
              using the equation for one to define the arc of the bird.  After doing this, we didn't have the time to add our next wanted feature (moving
              spikes after a certain score) before the first gallery walk.  We tested the game for glitches, and found that the grayscale color scheme
              wasn't very pleasant to look at for long periods of time.  We changed the backgroud color to sky blue to help break up the screen layout.  We
              got a lot of feedback from the gallery walk that said to make the game harder.  We decided to carry out our plan to start moving one spike
              after level 10, and two spikes after level 15.  This was the hardest part of the project, since the spikes would keep facing the wrong
              direction while moving.  In the end, I went and changed the image file for the spikes so the spikes would always face in all directions.
              This project taught me that there are multiple ways of coding things, though some work better than others.  It also showed me that it can be
              hard to find certain bits of code if everything is unorganised.

            <h3>Photo Manipulation</h3>

              For the Photo Manipulation Project, I had to create a program to edit images based off of one of four prompts.  Me and my partner chose the 
              promt which stated: "Your client is a family that would like a standard frame applied to a large number of pictures that feature one or 
              more of the family members.  They want the composite image to be memorable and to incorporate some personalized symbol, image, or silhouette 
              that represents the interests of the family member(s).  The client enjoys abstract art as well and might like to see geometric shape 
              incorporated in the imageâ€”drawn on, as a border, or as a mask.  The client enjoys participating in the creative process and will appreciate 
              being offered a range of options (as a parameter) for one of the image operations you perform."  Me and my partner started brainstorming 
              and decided on three main functions, adding a border of at least four shapes, changing the color of this border, and adding a logo.  As we 
              were coding these functions, we got more ideas for what to include in our project.  We added a feature that lets you put text anywhere on 
              your image, and we mamged to turn any image black and white.  My role in this project was lead programmer, coding the majority of the 
              project.  I learned a lot about the Python Imaging Library, and how methods and liraries work in general.  A few challenges we overcame were 
              the fact that in our grayscale function, the alpha channel was being added to the average, so we had to split up and then added.  Another 
              challenge we had was when a raw_input function is used in Python, it always returns a string, which was problematic for intaking an rgb 
              color value from the user.  We solved this problem by looking at a similar problem someone had on Stack Overflow, and by looking at python 
              documentation for the .split function to split the string into three integers.  Our team was strong because we knew each others' strengths 
              and weaknesses.  I knew how to find the right function and use them, while my partner could follow along and help get over error, while 
              also doing documentation.
